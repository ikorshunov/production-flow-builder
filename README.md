# Production Flow Builder

To launch the application you will need to have:

-   [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
-   [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

As soon as these two tools installed, execute the following:

```
nvm install 20
yarn
yarn demo
```

This will start a server with project demo.
